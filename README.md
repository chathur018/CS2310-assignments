Each assignment folder contains the relevant problem statement and the corresponding solution files containing the code that were submitted.

These files are meant to be tested using the simulators provided by <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand to Tetris</a>

Each of the assignments has implementaions for different components of the Hack CPU.
